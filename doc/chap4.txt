  [1X4.1 [33X[0;0YThe idea of hashing[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  one wants to store a certain set of similar objects and wants to quickly
  access  a  given  one (or come back with the result that it is unknown), the
  first  idea  would  be  to  store them in a list, possibly sorted for faster
  access.  This  however  still  would need [22Xlog(n)[122X comparisons to find a given
  element or to decide that it is not yet stored.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTherefore  one  uses a much bigger array and uses a function on the space of
  possible  objects with integer values to decide, where in the array to store
  a  certain  object. If this so called hash function distributes the actually
  stored  objects  well  enough over the array, the access time is constant in
  average.  Of  course,  a hash function will usually not be injective, so one
  needs  a  strategy  what to do in case of a so-called [21Xcollision[121X, that is, if
  more than one object with the same hash value has to be stored. This package
  provides  two  ways  to  deal  with collisions, one is implemented in the so
  called  [21XHashTabs[121X  and  another  in  the [21XTreeHashTabs[121X. The former simply uses
  other  parts  of  the array to store the data involved in the collisions and
  the  latter  uses an AVL tree (see Chapter [14X8[114X) to store all data objects with
  the  same  hash value. Both are used basically in the same way but sometimes
  behave a bit differently.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  basic  functions  to  work with hash tables are [2XHTCreate[102X ([14X4.3-1[114X), [2XHTAdd[102X
  ([14X4.3-2[114X),  [2XHTValue[102X  ([14X4.3-3[114X),  [2XHTDelete[102X ([14X4.3-5[114X) and [2XHTUpdate[102X ([14X4.3-4[114X). They are
  described in Section [14X4.3[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  legacy  functions from older versions of this package to work with hash
  tables  are  [2XNewHT[102X  ([14X4.4-1[114X),  [2XAddHT[102X  ([14X4.4-2[114X),  and [2XValueHT[102X ([14X4.4-3[114X). They are
  described  in  Section  [14X4.4[114X.  In  the  next  section,  we first describe the
  infrastructure for hash functions.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.2 [33X[0;0YHash functions[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the  [5Xorb[105X  package  hash  functions  are chosen automatically by giving a
  sample  object together with the length of the hash table. This is done with
  the following operation:[133X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ya record[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe first argument [3Xob[103X must be a sample object, that is, an object like those
  we  want to store in the hash table later on. The argument [3Xlen[103X is an integer
  that  gives  the  length  of  the hash table. Note that this might be called
  later  on  automatically,  when  a  hash  table  is  increased  in size. The
  operation  returns a record with two components. The component [10Xfunc[110X is a [5XGAP[105X
  function  taking  two  arguments,  see below. The component [10Xdata[110X is some [5XGAP[105X
  object.  Later  on, the hash function will be called with two arguments, the
  first  is  the object for which it should call the hash value and the second
  argument must be the data stored in the [10Xdata[110X component.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  hash  function  has  to return values between [22X1[122X and the hash length [3Xlen[103X
  inclusively.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis setup is chosen such that the hash functions can be global objects that
  are  not  created  during  the execution of [2XChooseHashFunction[102X but still can
  change their behaviour depending on the data.[133X

        [33X[0;6YIf  this  component  is  bound  the  type  of  the  hash  table  is  a

        of  the  hash table. Note that for this type of hash table the keys to
        be  stored  in  the  hash  must  be  comparable  using  [22X<[122X. A three-way

        [33X[0;6YIf this component is set to [9Xtrue[109X then the user guarantees that all the

        with  no  subobjects.  For  example  lists  of immediate integers will
        fulfill   this   requirement,  but  ranges  don't.  In  this  case,  a
        particularly  good  and  efficient hash function will automatically be
        taken  and the components [10Xhashfunc[110X, [10Xhfbig[110X and [10Xhfdbig[110X are ignored. Note
        that this cannot be automatically detected because it depends not only
        on the sample point but also potentially on all the other points to be
        stored in the hash table.[133X

        [33X[0;6YIf these components are bound, they are used as the hash function. The
        value  of  [10Xhf[110X must be a function taking two arguments, the first being
        the  object  for  which  the  hash  function shall be computed and the
        second  being  the value of [10Xhfd[110X. The returned value must be an integer
        in  the  range  from  [22X1[122X  to the length of the hash. If either of these
        components  is not bound, an automatic choice for the hash function is
        done  using  [2XChooseHashFunction[102X ([14X4.2-1[114X) and the supplied sample object
        [3Xsample[103X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YNote  that if you specify these two components and are using a HashTab
        table  then this table cannot grow unless you also bind the components

        [33X[0;6YThis  component can be bound to a three-way comparison function taking
        two  arguments  [3Xa[103X  and  [3Xb[103X (which will be keys for the TreeHashTab) and
        returns [22X-1[122X if [22X[3Xa[103X<[3Xb[103X[122X, [22X0[122X if [22X[3Xa[103X = [3Xb[103X[122X and [22X1[122X if [22X[3Xa[103X > [3Xb[103X[122X. If this component is not
        bound  the  function  [2XAVLCmp[102X  ([14X8.2-2[114X) is taken, which simply calls the
        generic operations [10X<[110X and [10X=[110X to do the job.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xhashlen[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  this  component  is bound the type of the hash table is a standard
        HashTab   table.  That  is,  collisions  are  dealt  with  by  storing
        additional  entries  in  other  slots.  This is the traditional way to
        implement a hash table. Note that currently deleting entries in such a
        hash  table is not implemented, since it could only be done by leaving
        a  [21Xdeleted[121X  mark which could pollute that hash table. Use TreeHashTabs
        instead  if  you  need  deletion. The value bound to [10Xhashlen[110X must be a
        positive integer and will be the initial length of the hash table.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YNote  that  it  is  a  good  idea to choose a prime number as the hash
        length  due  to  the  algorithm  for  collision  handling  which works
        particularly   well   in  that  case.  The  hash  function  is  chosen

        table  is  built  into  the hash function. If you still want your hash
        table  to  be  able  to  grow automatically, then bind a hash function
        returning  arbitrary integers to [10Xhfbig[110X, the corresponding data for the
        second  argument  to  [10Xhfdbig[110X  and  bind [10Xcangrow[110X to [9Xtrue[109X. Then the hash

  unbound  (empty), or bound to the only key stored in the hash which has this
  hash  value  or, if there is more than one key for that hash value, the slot
  is bound to an AVL tree containing all such keys (and values).[133X
  
  
  [1X4.5-1 [33X[0;0YMemory requirements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YDue to the data structure defined above the hash table will need one machine
  word  ([22X4[122X bytes on 32bit machines and [22X8[122X bytes on 64bit machines) per possible
  entry  in  the  hash  if all values corresponding to objects in the hash are
  [9Xtrue[109X and two machine words otherwise. This means that the memory requirement
  for  the hash itself is proportional to the hash table length and not to the
  number of objects actually stored in the hash![133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn addition one of course needs the memory to store the objects themselves.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  TreeHashTabs there are additional memory requirements. As soon as there
  are  more than one key hashing to the same value, the memory for an AVL tree
  object  is  needed  in  addition. An AVL tree objects needs about 10 machine
  words  for  the  tree object and then another 4 machine words for each entry
  stored  in the tree. Note that for many collisions this can be significantly
  more than for HashTab tables. However, the advantage of TreeHashTabs is that
  even  for a bad hash function the performance is never worse than [22Xlog(n)[122X for
  each  operation where [22Xn[122X is the number of keys in the hash with the same hash
  value.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.5-2 [33X[0;0YHandling of collisions[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis section is only relevant for HashTab objects.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  two  or more objects have the same hash value, the following is done: If
  the hash value is coprime to the hash length, the hash value is taken as [21Xthe
  increment[121X,  otherwise  [22X1[122X  is taken. The code to find the proper place for an
  object just repeatedly adds the increment to the current position modulo the
  hash length. Due to the choice of the increment this will eventually try all
  places  in  the  hash  table.  Every  such  increment  step  is counted as a
  collision  in  the  [10Xcollisions[110X  component  in the hash table. This algorithm
  explains why it is sensible to choose a prime number as the length of a hash
  table.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.5-3 [33X[0;0YEfficiency[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YHashing is efficient as long as there are not too many collisions. It is not
  a  problem if the number of collisions (counted in the [10Xcollisions[110X component)
  is smaller than the number of accesses (counted in the [10Xaccesses[110X component).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  high  number  of collisions can be caused by a bad hash function, because
  the  hash  table  is  too small (do not fill a hash table to more than about
  80%),  or because the objects to store are just not well enough distributed.
  Hash  tables  will grow automatically if too many collisions are detected or
  if they are filled to 80%.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  advantage  of  TreeHashTabs  is  that  even for a bad hash function the
  performance  is  never  worse  than [22Xlog(n)[122X for each operation where [22Xn[122X is the
  number  of  keys  in the hash with the same hash value. However, they need a
