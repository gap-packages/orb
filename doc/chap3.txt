  [33X[0;0YThis package contains a new implementation of the standard orbit enumeration
  algorithm. The design principles for this implementation have been:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YAllow partial orbit enumeration and later continuation.[133X

  [30X    [33X[0;6YAllow for searching in orbits during orbit enumeration.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSome  of  these  design  principles  made  it  necessary  to change the user
  interface in comparison to the standard [5XGAP[105X one.[133X
  
  
  [1X3.1 [33X[0;0YEnumerating orbits[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  enumeration  of  an  orbit works in at least two stages: First an orbit
  object  is created with all the necessary information to describe the orbit.
  Then  the actual enumeration is started. The latter stage can be repeated as
  many times as needed in the case that the orbit enumeration stopped for some
  reason  before the orbit was enumerated completely. See below for conditions
  under which this happens.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor orbit object creation there is the following function:[133X
  
  [1X3.1-1 Orb[101X
  
  [29X[2XOrb[102X( [3Xgens[103X, [3Xpoint[103X, [3Xop[103X[, [3Xopt[103X] ) [32X function
  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10YAn orbit object[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  argument  [3Xgens[103X  is  either a [5XGAP[105X group, semigroup or monoid object or a
  list  of generators of the magma acting, [3Xpoint[103X is a point in the orbit to be
  enumerated,  [3Xop[103X is a [5XGAP[105X function describing the action of the generators on
  points  in  the usual way, that is, [10X[3Xop[103X[10X(p,g)[110X returns the result of the action
  of the element [10Xg[110X on the point [10Xp[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  in the case of a semigroup or monoid acting not all options make
  sense  (for  example  stabilisers  only  work  for groups). In this case the
  [21Xdirected[121X or [21Xweak[121X orbit is computed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  optional  argument  [3Xopt[103X  is  a [5XGAP[105X record which can contain quite a few
  options  changing  the orbit enumeration. For a list of possible options see
  Subsection [14X3.1-4[114X at the end of this section.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function returns an [21Xorbit[121X object that can later be used to enumerate (a
  part of) the orbit of [3Xpoint[103X under the action of the group generated by [3Xgens[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  [3Xgens[103X  is  a  group,  semigroup or monoid object, then its generators are
  taken  as  the  list of generators acting. If a group object knows its size,
  then  this  size  is  used  to  speed  up orbit and in particular stabiliser
  computations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe following operation actually starts the orbit enumeration:[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[3Xorb[103X  must  be  an orbit object created by [2XOrb[102X ([14X3.1-1[114X). The optional argument
  [3Xlimit[103X  must  be a positive integer meaning that the orbit enumeration should
  stop  if  [3Xlimit[103X  points  have  been  found,  regardless whether the orbit is
  complete  or  not. Note that the orbit enumeration can be continued by again
  calling the [2XEnumerate[102X operation. If the argument [3Xlimit[103X is omitted, the whole
  orbit is enumerated, unless other options lead to prior termination.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo see whether an orbit is closed you can use the following operation:[133X
  
  [1X3.1-3 IsClosed[101X
  
  [29X[2XIsClosed[102X( [3Xorb[103X ) [32X operation

  length,  access entries, and ask, whether a given point lies in the orbit or
  not.  Due  to  the hashing techniques used such lookups are quite fast, they
  usually only use a constant time regardless of the length of the orbit![133X

  [33X[0;0YThe optional fourth argument [3Xopt[103X of the function [2XOrb[102X ([14X3.1-1[114X) is a [5XGAP[105X record
  and  its  components  change the behaviour of the orbit enumeration. In this
  subsection  we explain the use of the components of this options record. All
  components are themselves optional. For every component we also describe the
  possible values in the following list:[133X
  
  [8X[10Xeqfunc[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  component  always  has  to  be given together with the component
        [10Xhashfunc[110X.  If  both are given, they are used to set up a hash table to
        store  the  points in the orbit. You have to use this if the automatic
        mechanism  to  find  a  suitable  hash function does not work for your
        starting point in the orbit.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YNote  that  if  you  use  this  feature,  the  hash  table cannot grow
        automatically  any  more, unless you also use the components [10Xhfbig[110X and
        [10Xhfdbig[110X  as  well.  See  the  description  of  [2XGrowHT[102X  ([14X4.4-5[114X)  for  an
        explanation how to use this feature.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xgenstoapply[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis is only used internally and is intentionally not documented.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xgradingfunc[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  this  component is bound it must be bound to a function taking two
        arguments,  the  first is the orbit object, the second is a new point.
        This function is called for every new point and is supposed to compute
        a  [21Xgrade[121X  for  the  point  which  can  be an arbitrary [5XGAP[105X object. The
        resulting  values  are  then  stored  in a list of equal length to the
        orbit  and can later be queried with the [2XGrades[102X ([14X3.1-11[114X) operation. If
        this  feature  is  used  the  orbit  object  will  lie  in  the filter
        [2XIsGradedOrbit[102X  ([14X3.1-10[114X).  In connection with the [10Xonlygrades[110X option the
        enumeration  of an orbit can be limited to points with certain grades,
        see below.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xgrpsizebound[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YPossible  values  for this component are positive integers. By setting
        this value one can help the orbit enumeration to complete earlier. The
        given number must be an upper bound for the order of the group. If the
        exact group order is given and the stabiliser is calculated during the
        orbit enumeration (see component [10Xpermgens[110X), then the orbit enumeration
        can  stop  as soon as the orbit is found completely and the stabiliser
        is  complete,  which  is usually much earlier than after all generator
        are applied to all points in the orbit.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xforflatplainlists[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf this component is set to [9Xtrue[109X then the user guarantees that all the
        points  in  the  orbit  will be flat plain lists, that is, plain lists
        with  no  subobjects.  For  example  lists  of immediate integers will
        fulfill   this   requirement,  but  ranges  don't.  In  this  case,  a
        particularly  good  and  efficient hash function will automatically be
        taken  and  the components [10Xhf[110X, [10Xhfd[110X, [10Xhfbig[110X and [10Xhfdbig[110X are ignored. Note
        that this cannot be automatically detected because it depends not only
        on  the  first  point of the orbit but also on the other points in the
        orbit and thus on the group generators given.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xhashfunc[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  component  always  has  to  be  given  together  with the [10Xeqfunc[110X
        component  (see  also  there).  The  value  should  be  a  record with
        components  [10Xfunc[110X  and  [10Xdata[110X.  The  former is used as the hash function
        (component  [10Xhf[110X  in  the options to [2XHTCreate[102X ([14X4.3-1[114X)) and the latter as
        data argument (component [10Xhfd[110X). The length of the hash is determined by
        the  value of the component [10Xhashlen[110X. If a tree hash is to be used, the
        component  [10Xtreehashsize[110X has to be used instead of [10Xhashlen[110X. If you want
        to  use  a  hash  table that can grow automatically, use the [10Xhfbig[110X and
        [10Xhtdbig[110X  components  together  with  [10Xhashlen[110X  for the initial size. See
        [2XHTCreate[102X ([14X4.3-1[114X) for details.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xhashlen[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YPossible  values  are positive integers. This component determines the
        initial  size  of the hash used for the orbit enumeration. The default
        value is [22X10000[122X. If the hash table turns out not to be large enough, it
        is  automatically increased by a factor of two during the calculation.
        Although  this  process is quite fast it still improves performance to
        give a sensible hash size in advance.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xhfbig[110X[8X and [10Xhfdbig[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThese  components  can  only  be  used  in  connection with [10Xeqfunc[110X and
        [10Xhashfunc[110X  and are otherwise ignored. There values are simply passed on
        to  the  hash  table created. The idea is to still be able to grow the
        hash table if need be. See Section [14X4.5[114X for more details.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xtreehashsize[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  component  indicates  that instead of a normal hash table a tree
        hash  table  (TreeHashTab) should be used (see Section [14X4.1[114X). If bound,
        it  must be set to the length of the tree hash table. You should still
        choose this length big enough, however, this type of hash table should
        be  more  resilient  to  bad  hash  functions since the performance of
        operations  will only deteriorate up to [22Xlog(n)[122X instead of to [22Xn[122X (number
        of  entries). If you use this option your hash keys must be comparable
        by  [10X<[110X  and not only by [10X=[110X. You can supply your own three-way comparison
        function (see [2XHTCreate[102X ([14X4.3-1[114X)) by using the [10Xcmpfunc[110X component.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xcmpfunc[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  the  previous  component  [10Xtreehashsize[110X is bound, you can specify a
        three-way comparison function for the hash keys in this component. See
        [2XHTCreate[102X ([14X4.3-1[114X) and [2XAVLCmp[102X ([14X8.2-2[114X) for details.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xlog[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  this component is set to [9Xtrue[109X then a log of the enumeration of the
        orbit  is  written  into  the components [10Xlog[110X, [10Xlogind[110X and [10Xlogpos[110X. Every
        time  a  new  point is found in the orbit enumeration, two numbers are
        appended  to  the log, first the number of the generator applied, then
        the  index, under which the new point is stored in the orbit. For each
        point  in the orbit, the start of the entries for that point in [10Xlog[110X is
        stored in [10Xlogind[110X and the end of those entries is marked by storing the
        number of the last generator producing a new point negated.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YThe  purpose  of  a log is the following: With a log one can later add
        group  generators to the orbit and thus get a different Schreier tree,
        such  that  the  resulting  orbit enumeration is still a breadth first
        enumeration  using  the  new  generating  set!  This  is  desirable to
        decrease  the  depth  of the Schreier tree. The log helps to implement
        this  in  a  way, such that the old generators do not again have to be
        applied  to  all  the  points  in  the orbit. See [2XAddGeneratorsToOrbit[102X
        ([14X3.1-20[114X) for details.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YA log needs roughly 3 machine words per point in the orbit as memory.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xlookingfor[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  component is used to search for something in the orbit. The idea
        is  that  the orbit enumeration is stopped when some condition is met.
        This  condition  can  be specified with a great flexibility. The first
        way is to store a list of points into [10Xorb.lookingfor[110X. In that case the
        orbit enumeration stops, when a point is found that is in that list. A
        second possiblity is to store a hash table object into [10Xorb.lookingfor[110X.
        Then  every  newly  found point in the orbit is looked up in that hash
        table and the orbit enumeration stops as soon as a point is found that
        is  also  in  the hash table. The third possibility is functional: You
        can store a [5XGAP[105X function into [10Xopt.lookingfor[110X which is called for every
        newly  found point in the orbit. It gets both the orbit object and the
        point  as its two arguments. This function has to return [9Xfalse[109X or [9Xtrue[109X
        and in the latter case the orbit enumeration is stopped.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YWhenever  the  orbit enumeration is stopped the component [10Xfound[110X is set
        to the number of the found point in the orbit. Access this information
        using [10XPositionOfFound(orb)[110X.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xmatgens[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis is not yet implemented. It will allow for stabiliser computations
        in matrix groups.[133X
  
  [8X[10Xonlygrades[110X[8X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  option  is to limit the orbit enumeration to points with certain
        grades (see option [10Xgradingfunc[110X). The primary way to do this is to bind
        [10Xonlygrades[110X  to a function taking two arguments. The first is the grade
        value,  the  second  is  the  value bound to the option [10Xonlygradesdata[110X
        below. The function is then called for every new point after its grade
        is  computed.  If the function returns [9Xtrue[109X the point is stored in the
        orbit  as  usual,  if it returns [9Xfalse[109X the point is dropped. Note that
