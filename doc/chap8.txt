  [1X8.1 [33X[0;0YThe idea of AVL trees[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAVL  trees  are  balanced  binary  trees called [21XAVL trees[121X in honour of their
  inventors  G.M. Adelson-Velskii and E.M. Landis (see [AVM62]). A description
  in English can be found in [Knu97] in Section 6.2.3 about balanced trees.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  general idea is to store data in a binary tree such that all entries in
  the  left  subtree  of a node are smaller than the entry at the node and all
  entries  in  the  right  subtree are bigger. The tree is kept [21Xbalanced[121X which
  means that for each node the depth of the left and right subtrees differs by
  at  most  1. In this way, finding something in the tree, adding a new entry,
  deleting  an  entry  all  have  complexity  [22Xlog(n)[122X  where [22Xn[122X is the number of
  entries in the tree. If one additionally stores the number of entries in the
  left  subtree  of  each node, then finding the [22Xk[122X-th entry, removing the [22Xk[122X-th
  entry  and inserting an entry in position [22Xk[122X also have complexity [22Xlog(n)[122X. The
  [5Xorb[105X  contains  an  implementation  of  such tree objects providing all these
  operations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[21XEntries[121X  in  AVL tree objects are key-value pairs and the sorting is done by
  the  key. If all values as [9Xtrue[109X then no memory is needed to store the values
  (see  the  corresponding behaviour for hash tables). The only requirement on
  the  type  of  the keys is that two arbitrary keys must be comparable in the
  sense  that  one  can  decide  which  of  them  is smaller. If [5XGAP[105Xs standard
  comparison  operations  [22X<[122X  and  [22X=[122X  work  for your keys, no further action is
  required,  if  not,  then  you  must  provide  your own three-way comparison
  function (see below).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  the  AVL  trees  implemented  here  can be used in basically two
  different  ways, which can sometimes be mixed: The usual way is by accessing
  entries  by  their  key,  the  tree  is  then automatically kept sorted. The
  alternative  way  is  by accessing entries by their index in the tree! Since
  the  nodes  of the trees remember how many elements are stored in their left
  subtree,  it  is  in  fact  possible to access the [22Xk[122X-th entry in the tree or
  delete  it.  It is even possible to insert something in position [22Xk[122X. However,
  note  that  if you do this latter operation, you are yourself responsible to
  keep the entries in the tree sorted. You can ignore this responsibility, but
  then  you  can no longer access the entries in the tree by their key and the
  corresponding functions might fail or even run into errors.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  usage  can  be  useful,  since  in  this  way  AVL  trees  provide  an
  implementation  of a list data structure where the operation list access (by
  index), adding an element (in an arbitrary position) and deleting an element
  (by  its  index) all have complexity [22Xlog(n)[122X where [22Xn[122X is the number of entries
  in the list.[133X
  
  
  [1X8.2 [33X[0;0YUsing AVL trees[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn AVL tree is created using the following function:[133X
  
  [1X8.2-1 AVLTree[101X
  
  [29X[2XAVLTree[102X( [[3Xopt[103X] ) [32X function
  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10YA new AVL tree object[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis function creates a new AVL tree object. The optional argument [3Xopt[103X is an
  options record, in which you can bind the following components:[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10Xcmpfunc[110X  is a three-way comparison function taking two arguments [3Xa[103X and [3Xb[103X and
  returning  [22X-1[122X  if [22X[3Xa[103X < [3Xb[103X[122X, [22X+1[122X if [22X[3Xa[103X > [3Xb[103X[122X and [22X0[122X if [22X[3Xa[103X = [3Xb[103X[122X. If no function is given
  then the generic function [2XAVLCmp[102X ([14X8.2-2[114X) is taken. This three-way comparison
  function  is  stored  with  the tree and is used for all comparisons in tree
  operations.  [10Xallocsize[110X  is  the  number of nodes which are allocated for the
  tree  initially. It can be useful to specify this if you know that your tree
  will  eventually  contain  a lot of entries, since then the tree object does
  not have to grow that many times.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  every  AVL  tree a three-way comparison function is needed, usually you
  can get away with using the following default one:[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis function calls the [9X<[109X operation and the [9X=[109X operation to provide a generic

  [33X[0;0YThe  first  argument [3Xt[103X must be an AVL tree. This function stores the key [3Xkey[103X
  with  value  [3Xvalue[103X  in  the  tree  assuming  that  the keys in it are sorted
  according  to  the  three-way  comparison  function stored with the tree. If
  [3Xvalue[103X  is  [9Xtrue[109X then no additional memory is needed. It is an error if there

  [33X[0;0YAn  AVL  tree is a positional object in which the first 7 positions are used
  for administrative data (see table below) and then from position 8 on follow
  the  nodes of the tree. Each node uses 4 positions such that all nodes begin
  at  positions  divisible  by  4.  The system allocates the positional object
  larger than actually needed such that not every new node leads to the object
  being  copied.  Nodes  which  become  free are collected in a free list. The
  following table contains the information what is stored in each of the first
  7 entries:[133X
  
        1 │ last actually used position, is always congruent 3 mod 4             
        2 │ position of first node in free list                                  
        3 │ number of currently used nodes in the tree                           
        4 │ position of largest allocated position is always congruent 3 mod 4   
        5 │ three-way comparison function                                        
        6 │ position of the top node                                             
        7 │ a plain list holding the values stored under the keys                
  
  [33X[0;0YThe four positions used for a node contain the following information, recall
  that each node starts at a position divisible by 4:[133X
  
        0 mod 4 │ reference to the key                                              
        1 mod 4 │ position of left node or 0 if empty, balance factor (see below)   
        2 mod 4 │ position of right node or 0 if empty                              
        3 mod 4 │ index: number of nodes in left subtree plus one                   
  
  [33X[0;0YSince  all  positions  of  nodes  are  divisible  by 4, we can use the least
  significant  two  bits  of the left node reference for the so called balance
  factor.  Balance factor 0 (both bits 0) indicates that the depth of the left
  subtree  is  equal to the depth of the right subtree. Balance factor 1 (bits
  01)  indicates  that  the depth of the right subtree is one greater than the
  depth of the left subtree. Balance factor 2 (or -1 in [Knu97], here bits 10)
  indicates  that  the depth of the left subtree is one greater than the depth
  of the right subtree.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  freed nodes the position of the next free node in the free list is held
  in the 0 mod 4 position and 0 means the end of the free list.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YPosition 7 in the positional object can contain the value [9Xfail[109X, in this case
  all  stored  values are [9Xtrue[109X. This is a measure to limit the memory usage in
  the  case  that  the only relevant information in the tree is the key and no
  values  are  stored  there.  This  is  in particular interesting if the tree
  structure is just used as a list implementation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  all functions dealing with AVL trees are both implemented on the
  [5XGAP[105X  level and on the kernel level. Both implementations do exactly the same
  thing,  the  kernel  version  is  only  much faster and tuned for efficiency
  whereas  the [5XGAP[105X version documents the functionality better and is used as a
  fallback if the C-part of the [5Xorb[105X is not compiled.[133X
