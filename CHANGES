This file describes changes in the orb package.

4.9.1 (2024-08-26)
  - Require GAP >= 4.12
  - More hash functions now detect invalid input and return `fail`
    instead of returning garbage (like hashes of random memory blocks,
    or the constant 0) or even crashing.
  - Update build system
  - Various janitorial changes

4.9.0 (2022-09-26)
  - Validate the output of hash functions in the C implementation,
    and report bad values as errors, instead of crashing or corrupting
    data. This also means that code which previously did run may now
    raise errors; usually that's a good thing, as it flags an error,
    but it may be that in rare cases a correct computation is affected
    by this. If so, please report this via our bug tracker, i.e.,
    <https://github.com/gap-packages/orb/issues>

4.8.5 (2022-07-25)
  - Make `Orb` option `lookingfor` accept non legacy HT
  - Update build system
  - Various janitorial changes

4.8.4 (2021-09-07)
  - Update build system
  - Various janitorial changes

4.8.3 (2019-09-03)
  - Adjust examples and tests for compatibility with AtlasRep 2.x
  - Various janitorial changes

4.8.2 (2019-02-23)
  - Rewrote build system to use gac, not autoconf/automake/libtool
  - Improve compatibility with upcoming GAP 4.11
  - Fix for using the package without compilation (works again now)
  - Various janitorial changes

4.8.1 (2018-09-10)
  - Deal with hash functions returning 'fail', or any other non-integer
    (instead of crashing or doing other random things)
  - Change several ORB_HashFunction to return fail if necessary
  - Require GAP >= 4.9
  - Update build system for better compatibility with GAP >= 4.9

4.8.0 (2017-11-10)
  - Renamed the IsClosed filter to IsClosedOrbit, and added a new operation
    IsClosed which simply returns the value of the IsClosedOrbit filter.
    This allows other packages do also use the name IsClosed.
  - Fix hash tables with initial size <= 5 not growing correctly
  - Fix ORB_HashFunctionModWrapper
  - Fix bug in HTGrow causing it to never call ORB_HashFunctionModWrapper
  - Ensure compatibility with GAP 4.9

4.7.6 (2016-03-08)
  - Move MappingPermListList C implementation from orb to the GAP kernel
  - Fix regression which prevent orb from being used without compilation
  - Some changes to the C code for compatibility with HPC-GAP (resp. ward)

4.7.5 (2016-01-20)
  - Add a hash function for blists
  - Technical change: orbit objects are not collections anymore (fixes issue #10,
    where sometimes \in returned wrong results for orbits)
  - Improve test suite

4.7.4 (2016-01-07)
  - Show an error when the user tries to compute orbits of objects for
    which no ChooseHashFunction method is available. Previously, it would
    fall back to a "trivial" hash function, which lead to worst-case
    performance.
  - Require GAP >= 4.6
  - Remove Jenkins hash in favor of the Murmur hash built into GAP
  - Clarify that the code is licensed under GPL v3.
  - Document that MakeSchreierTreeShallow only works for orbits with log.
  - Move website to https://gap-packages.github.io/orb/

4.7.3 (2014-11-08)
  - Tweak the build system to avoid potential issues when the source
    code gets repackages by third parties (e.g. by the GAP team, when
    creating their big package archives)
  - Fix a missing variable initialization, which could cause Enumerate
    (and hence anything using it, such as FindShortGeneratorsOfSubgroup)
    to run into an error.

4.7.2 (2014-09-24)
  - Fix error in Memory() method for orbit-by-suborbit setup objects.
  - Update Max Neunhoeffer's contact data
  - Use AutoDoc to generate title page of the manual from PackageInfo.g
  - Add Max Horn as a maintainer

4.7.1 (2014-04-04)
  - Previous release had an invalid release date in
    PackageInfo.g (2014-04-31 instead of 2014-03-31).
  - Merge HISTORY and CHANGES files.

4.7 (2014-03-31)
  - Use hash functions for transformations and partial permutations
    provided by newer GAP versions instead of our own. This way,
    if the internal representation for these objects changes
    (as has recently happened), we stay compatible (see issue #3).
  - Fix bug were orb logs were not properly updated if the enumeration
    stopped early (see issues #4 and #5).
  - Fix bug caused by orbits with seeds (see issue #5).
  - Update and tweak the package build system.

    ImageAndKernelOfTransformation, CanonicalTransSameKernel and
    IsInjectiveTransOnList
  - No longer load the GAP versions of those for GAP >= 4.7
  - Fix hash function for transformations for GAP >= 4.7
  - Add hash function for partial perms for GAP >= 4.7

4.5 (2012-05-30)

    vectors. This was found in the context of the genss package.
